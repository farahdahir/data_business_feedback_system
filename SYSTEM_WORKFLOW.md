## 🎯 System Overview

The KRA Feedback Management System is a **communication platform** that bridges the gap between:
- **Business Team**: Users who need dashboard modifications
- **Data Science Teams**: Teams responsible for creating/maintaining dashboards
- **Admin**: System administrators who manage everything

### Core Purpose
Replace manual communication (emails, WhatsApp, calls) with a structured, trackable system for dashboard feedback and issue resolution.

## 🚀 System Startup Flow

```
1. Server starts (index.js)
   ↓
2. Loads environment variables (.env)
   ↓
3. Connects to PostgreSQL database
   ↓
4. Tests database connection
   ↓
5. Sets up Express middleware
   ↓
6. Registers all routes
   ↓
7. Initializes Socket.io
   ↓
8. Server ready on port 5000
   ↓
9. Client starts (React)
   ↓
10. Checks for stored auth token
   ↓
11. If token exists → Validates with backend
   ↓
12. Loads user data
   ↓
13. Renders appropriate dashboard based on role
```

---

## 📱 User Interface Flow

### Business User Journey
```
Login → Home (Dashboard List) → Dashboard Detail → Create Thread → My Threads → View Replies
```

### Data Science User Journey
```
Login → Home (Team Issues) → Thread Detail → Reply → Update Status → Complete
```

### Admin Journey
```
Login → Admin Dashboard → (Dashboards/Teams/Users/Issues) → Manage → Save
```

---

## 🔄 Status Lifecycle

```
[Pending]
   │
   │ (Data Science replies)
   ▼
[In Progress]
   │
   │ (Data Science marks complete)
   ▼
[Complete] ← Locked (no more replies)
```

**Rules:**
- Can only mark complete if there's a reply
- Cannot delete if in progress
- Cannot reply if complete

---

## 📈 Priority System

```
Thread Created → Priority: 1
   │
   │ (User seconds)
   ▼
Priority: 2 → Marked as "Critical"
   │
   │ (More seconds)
   ▼
Priority: 3, 4, 5... → Higher priority
```

**Impact:**
- Critical threads highlighted
- Appear higher in lists
- Data Science team prioritizes them

---

This workflow documentation covers the complete system. Every feature, user action, and data flow is designed to facilitate smooth communication between Business and Data Science teams while maintaining proper access control and tracking.
