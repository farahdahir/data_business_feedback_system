2. **teams** - Data science teams (Team 1-5, expandable)
3. **dashboards** - Dashboard metadata
4. **charts** - Chart metadata (linked to dashboards)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Thread Management
- Business users can create threads with subject, description, and optional chart selection
- Threads can be seconded by other business users (increases priority)
- Threads have 3 statuses: Pending, In Progress, Complete
- Thread deletion rules enforced (cannot delete in_progress threads)

### 2. Status Workflow
- **Pending**: Initial state, no data science response yet
- **In Progress**: Data science team has responded, working on issue
- **Complete**: Issue resolved, no more replies allowed
- Status can only be marked complete if there's a reply from data science team

### 3. Priority System
- Threads start with priority 1
- Each "second" increases priority
- Threads with 2+ seconds are marked as "Critical"
- Critical threads are highlighted in data science interface

### 4. Notifications
- Real-time notifications via Socket.io
- Database-backed notifications for persistence
- Notifications for:
  - New replies to threads
  - Status updates
  - Issue assignments
- Floating notification panel accessible from any page

### 5. Search & Filtering
- Business users can:
  - Search dashboards by name/description
  - Filter by team
  - Sort by name, date modified, date created
- Data science users can:
  - Filter by status
  - Filter by priority (critical)
  - Sort by most recent activity, status, created time
  - Group by dashboard
