## 👥 User Roles & Workflows

### Business User Workflow
1. **Register/Login** → Select "Business" role (no team assignment needed)
2. **Browse Dashboards** → View all available dashboards
3. **Create Feedback** → Select dashboard (and optionally a chart/visual) → Submit feedback
4. **Track Threads** → View "My Threads" to see all your threads and seconded threads
5. **Get Notified** → Receive real-time notifications when data science teams respond

### Data Science User Workflow
1. **Register/Login** → Select "Data Science" role (admin assigns team later)
2. **View Team Issues** → See all threads assigned to your team
3. **Respond to Threads** → Reply to business user feedback
4. **Update Status** → Mark threads as complete when done
5. **Submit Requests** → Contact admin for dashboard changes or team management

### Admin Workflow
1. **Create Admin Account** → Use the create-admin script
2. **Set Up Teams** → Create teams (Team 1-5 or more)
3. **Add Dashboards** → Create dashboards and add charts/visuals to them
4. **Manage Users** → Add users, assign to teams, make team leads
5. **Assign Issues** → Assign threads to teams (status auto-changes to "in_progress")
6. **Monitor Progress** → View dashboard progress and system statistics

## 🔄 Status Workflow

The system uses an **automatic status workflow**:

```
[Pending] → Created by business user
    ↓
[In Progress] → Automatically set when admin assigns to team
    ↓
[Complete] → Manually set by assigned team when work is done
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ `pending` → Set automatically when thread is created
- ✅ `in_progress` → Set automatically when admin assigns to team/user
- ✅ `complete` → Only assigned team can mark as complete (admin cannot)
- ✅ Admin has full visibility but cannot mark threads as complete
